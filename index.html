<h1>Welcome to Yuheng's homepage</h1>
<p>Hi! I am a Postdoctoral Fellow of computer science at City University of Hong Kong. My research interests broadly include topics in machine learning and data representation, such as low rank tensor/matrix approximation and factorization, unsupervised/semi-supervised clustering, and Bayesian modelling. </p>
<p>I defended my thesis on Nov. 2018, and officially received the Ph.D. degree from the Computer Science Department at City University of Hong Kong, where I was advised by Professor Sam Kwong. </p>
